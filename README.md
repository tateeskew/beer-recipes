beer-recipes
============

* My homebrew beer recipes. All of these will be all grain.

* Feel free to fork, add your own recipes and issue a pull request.  I suggest purchasing BeerSmith (yes, it does run on Linux) and exporting the recipes from there as PDF and also supply the beerxml format.  The formatting when exporting is really great if exported as the 'Classic Recipe' report.
